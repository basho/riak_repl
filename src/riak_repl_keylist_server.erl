%% @doc This is the server-side component of the new fullsync strategy
%% introduced in riak 1.1. It is an improvement over the previous strategy in
%% several ways:
%%
%% <ul>
%%   <li>Client and server build keylist in parallel</li>
%%   <li>No useless merkle tree is built</li>
%%   <li>Differences are calculated and transmitted in batches, not all in one
%%   message</li>
%%   <li>Backpressure is introduced in the exchange of differences</li>
%%   <li>Pausing/cancelling the diff is immediate</li>
%% </ul>
%%
%% In addition, the client does the requesting of partition data, which makes
%% this more of a pull model as compared to the legacy strategy, which was more
%% push oriented. The new protocol is outlined below.
%%
%% When the server receives a message to begin a fullsync, it checks that all
%% nodes in the cluster support the new bloom_fold capability, and relays the
%% command to the client. If bloom_fold is not supported by all nodes, it will
%% ignore the command and check again on the next fullsync request.
%%
%% For fullsync, the client builds the partition list and instructs the server
%% to build the keylist for the first partition, while also starting off its own
%% keylist build locally. When *both* builds are complete, the client sends
%% the keylist to the server. The server does the diff and then sends *any*
%% differing keys to the client, using the realtime repl protocol. This is a
%% departure from the legacy protocol in which vector clocks were available
%% for comparison. However, worst case is we try to write stale keys, which
%% will be ignored by the put_fsm. Once all the diffs are sent (and a final
%% ack is received), the client moves onto the next partition, if any.
%%
%% Note that the new key list algorithm uses a bloom fold filter to keep the
%% keys in disk-order to speed up the key-list creation process.
