-module(riak_repl_keylist_server).

%% @doc This is the server-side component of the new fullsync strategy
%% introduced in riak 1.1. It is an improvement over the previous strategy in
%% several ways:
%%
%% * Client and server build keylist in parallel
%% * No useless merkle tree is built
%% * Differences are calculated and transmitted in batches, not all in one
%%   message
%% * Backpressure is introduced in the exchange of differences
%% * Pausing/cancelling the diff is immediate
%%
%% In addition, the client does the requesting of partition data, which makes
%% this more of a pull model as compared to the legacy strategy, which was more
%% push oriented. The new protocol is outlined below.
%%
%% When the server receives a message to begin a fullsync, it relays it to the
%% client. The client builds the partition list and instructs the server to
%% build the keylist for the first partition, while also starting off its own
%% keylist build locally. When *both* builds are complete, the client sends
%% the keylist to the server. The server does the diff and then sends *any*
%% differing keys to the client, using the realtime repl protocol. This is a
%% departure from the legacy protocol in which vector clocks were available
%% for comparison. However, worst case is we try to write stale keys, which
%% will be ignored by the put_fsm. Once all the diffs are sent (and a final
% ack is received). The client moves onto the next partition, if any.
